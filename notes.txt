we should set align-content center on btn-div

also we should find find the usable format form dat -fn and use ti to generate a tag to show , the duration of it,
like in 2 days, 2 daays ago, the problem is to check what if the date is before from now, think about and

set up local storage , it would be a pain in the ass i think, should think when to call it for the state controll.
